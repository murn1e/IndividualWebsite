                <br>

                <li><b> My experience:</b></li>
                <p>Academic challenges, personal development, and memorable experiences abound in university life, from the thrill of forming new friendships in diverse communities to late-night study sessions in the library. 
                Group projects taught me the value of cooperation and flexibility, and attending lectures and participating in stimulating discussions helped me open my mind to new concepts</p>

                <br>
                <li><b>Lesson that i learned:</b></li>
                <p>My university education taught me things that went well beyond the classroom. I learnt the value of time management since it took careful preparation and self-control to balance my personal life, classes, and assignments. 
                I discovered the importance of tenacity overcoming obstacles like difficult tests or unsuccessful experiments taught me to press on even in the face of difficulty. Working with diverse groups of people taught me how different viewpoints result in stronger ideas, 
                so collaboration became crucial. I came to see that seeking assistance whether from peers or instructors is a show of strength rather than weakness. Above all, I discovered how to welcome change and progress, realising that every setback presents a chance to grow and learn.</p>
